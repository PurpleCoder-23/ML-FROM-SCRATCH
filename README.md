# ML-FROM-SCRATCH

# Implementing Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This project is part of my journey to **strengthen Python logic and coding skills** by building supervised machine learning algorithms **from scratch** — without relying on libraries like scikit-learn for training.

The first algorithm implemented is **Linear Regression**, followed by **Logistic Regression**, focusing on understanding the core mathematical steps and translating them into clean Python code.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Using **Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**, this project breaks down how a supervised ML model learns from data by manually coding each component.

You’ll see how to:

* Create and visualize a dataset
* Define the model and hypothesis function
* Implement the training loop
* Update parameters iteratively
* Make predictions
* Evaluate the model's performance
* Visualize training progress and results
* Compare results with prebuilt library implementations
