# 📈 Linear Regression from Scratch using Python & NumPy

This project demonstrates how to **implement Linear Regression from scratch** without using scikit-learn.
It highlights how the algorithm works internally — from **loss calculation** to **gradient descent**, **training**, and **model evaluation**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Using only **Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**, this project walks through each part of building Linear Regression manually.

You’ll see how to:

* Create and visualize a dataset
* Implement MSE as the loss function
* Apply gradient descent to update parameters
* Train the model across epochs
* Evaluate using MAE, RMSE, and R²
* Visualize the regression line and loss curve
* Compare results with scikit-learn
* Compare loss curves between both models
