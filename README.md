# ML-FROM-SCRATCH



#  Implementing Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This project is part of my journey to **strengthen Python logic and coding skills** by building supervised machine learning algorithms **from scratch** — without relying on libraries like scikit-learn for training.

The first algorithm implemented is **Linear Regression**, focusing on understanding the core mathematical steps and translating them into clean Python code.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Using **Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**, this project breaks down how a supervised ML model learns from data by manually coding each component.

You’ll see how to:

* Create and visualize a dataset
* Implement a loss function 
* Apply gradient descent to update parameters
* Train the model across epochs
* Evaluate performance using MAE, RMSE, and R²
* Visualize the loss curve
* Compare results with scikit-learn
* Compare loss curves between both approaches
